      <h1>Rendang</h1>
      <p>
        Rendang is a dish which originated from the Minangkabau ethnic group of
        Indonesia. The process involves slowly cooking meat in spiced coconut
        milk in an uncovered pot or pan until the oil separates, allowing the
        dish to fry in its own sauce, coating the meat in a rich, flavorful
        glaze.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Put all ingredients for the paste in a blender or food processor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 50 ml coconut milk to help the blending process and blend until
            smooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the beef and spice paste into a Wok or a large saucepan (minimum
            capacity 4 liters).
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in the coconut milk, add the lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves
            and turmeric leaves. Stir to mix.
          </li>
          <li>Cook over medium-high heat until the coconut milk get boiled.</li>
          <li>
            Adjust the heat into medium and simmer for 1.5 hours uncovered until
            the coconut milk becomes thicker and oily. Stirring occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the tamarind water and salt to taste. (Note: If you like to eat
            it with sauce you can stop the cooking now. This dish is called:
            Kalio /Wet Rendang)
          </li>
          <li>
            If you like to eat it as rendang then continue cooking on low heat
            for about 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook until the coconut milk is driven off and the beef and sauce
            becomes brown and almost dry. (At this stage you will probably need
            to stir all the time to prevent burning)
          </li>
          <li>Serve hot with rice and "Minangkabau Green Sambal".</li>
        </ol>
