              Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can
              meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
              are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
              modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we
              called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</span
